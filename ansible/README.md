# Quartermaster

## Goal

Implement a means to automate the provision of a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

One will require some basic knowledge of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), as this tool is used to automate the provisioning process, as well as 
a [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) account with [API access](https://www.vultr.com/api/). Aside from these, a Python setup with the pip available
is also required.
